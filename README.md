# Sol System's Cosmology
## Objective
I am writing this scene in an effort to build a spatially accurate model of the
Sol system's major heavenly bodies.  After getting the layout correct, I am
planning on attempting an animation, complete with text at specific points to
annotate certain ratios and relationships between the heavenly bodies.

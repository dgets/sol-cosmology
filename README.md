# Sol System's Cosmology
## Objective

I am writing this scene in an effort to build a _spatially accurate_ model of
the Sol system's major heavenly bodies.  After getting the layout correct, I am
planning on attempting an animation, complete with text at specific points, to
annotate certain ratios & relationships between the local heavenly bodies.
